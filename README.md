## How Well Do You Know Me?

 As part of my learning with **neoG Camp**, I made this project as the first of many in the Mark15 Checklist.

 This project is a small quiz of five simple questions about myself with scores. 
 
 If you follow me on [GitHub](https://github.com/nosfeeferatu) you already know one answer.

## Used:

1. JavaScript
1. readline-sync Package
1. Repl.it
